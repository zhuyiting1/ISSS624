## Overview

This is my first in-class exercise for geospatial analytics! We will review the key components of Hands-on Exercise 1 and learn more using the data from the In-class Exercise 1 zip file.

## Getting Started

### R packages

The code chunk below will install and load **tidyverse** and **sf** packages.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, sf)
```

**pacman** is a wrapper that wraps an installation package and a loading package, so that the package(s) is/are installed and loaded in one breath without having to use *install.packages()* + *library()*.

The syntax *pacman::* is necessary because while the package **pacman** is installed, it is not loaded. Hence, it needs to be specified so that R knows to use *p_load()* from **pacman** package.

When rendering, R is making sure that **tidyverse** and **sf** packages are installed.

To view the (local) webpage in web browser, using the bottom right-hand quadrant of the RStudio \> Files \> ISSS624 folder \> \_site \> In-class Ex \> In-class Ex1 \> In-class Ex1.html \> left-click select View in Web Browser.

### Data

Unzip **Hands-on_Ex1**, copy the **data** folder to C:/zhuyiting1/ISSS624/In-class_Ex/In-class_Ex1. It should be in the same folder as In-class_Ex1.qmd.

## Importing Geospatial Data

### Importing Polygon Features

This code chunk will import ESRI shapefile into R.

```{r}
mpsz <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial",
                layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
```

To read the syntax of the function, select the function name in the code and press F1. The Help page in the bottom right-hand quadrant of RStudio will open up.

The *dsn* argument is to tell st_read() where is the destination (relative path). As the code document (qmd file) is in the same directory as the data folder, we can start from "data/" to call the data folder within.

*Pro tip: Using the bottom right-hand quadrant, go to Files tab, go to the folder/subfolder that we are trying to import the data (in this case* data/geospatial*) and look at the folder and file names to key in as inputs for* st_read()*.*

From the output, we can obtain a couple of information including:

-   Projected CRS: SVY21 (Singapore-based projected coordinates system). Not in degrees format.

-   Unit of measurement: metres.

Under Environment tab in the top right-hand quadrant of RStudio, mpsz data is loaded in R. Clicking on the blue \|\> button to the left of *mpsz*, we can take a quick peek of the dataframe. Up to the first 10 records are displayed (to save space). To look at the dataframe in greater detail, click on the dataframe name *mpsz* to open the full data table.

### Importing and Transforming into Projected Coordinate System

Decimal degree format (between 0^o^ and 360^o^) good for exact location but not for distance measurement. This is because the Earth is ellipsoid and the distance gets closer further away from the equator in this format.

On the other hand, projected coordinate system flattens the Earth. This makes the distance roughly equivalent no matter where we are.

*Reading:* [Geographic vs Projected Coordinate Systems](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/gcs_vs_pcs/)

To convert **wgs84** (geographic coordinate system) to **svy21** (Singapore projected coordinate system), use the function *st_transform()* and argument *crs = 3414.*

The following code chunk imports the pre-schools location data (kml file) and pipes it into the transformation step in one sitting.

```{r}
preschool = st_read("data/geospatial/pre-schools-location-kml.kml") %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

While the output above still indicates geodetic CRS **wgs84**, when we click on preschool in the Environment tab to open the data table, we can see that the geometry values are no longer in degree decimal format.

Now, let's add the In-class Ex 1 data in the data folder.

We will also need the **spdep** package for this exercise. We do it by including it in the *p_load()* function.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, sf, spdep)
```

We also want to do some housekeeping to keep our laptop memory freed up from unused datasets. In the Environment tab, click on the broom logo to remove unused datasets.

Now we want to import the Hunan shapefile into R.

```{r}
mpsz <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial",
                layer = "Hunan")
```

We can see that the data is in geodetic CRS **wgs84**.

## Importing Attribute Data in CSV

### Aspatial Hunan data

The code chunk below imports the aspatial Hunan 2012 data.

```{r}
hunan <- read_csv("data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv")
```
